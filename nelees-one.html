      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Nelees One aims to redefine the smart home by starting where others don't look: the ceiling.
        Our goal is to embed intelligence, responsiveness, and connectivity into modular ceiling-mounted devices
        that eliminate the chaos of scattered gadgets and closed platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        By focusing on openness, community-driven development, and Matter-first compatibility,
        we want Nelees to become the backbone of ambient technology — not just for lighting or sensors,
        but for full-stack ambient computation and automation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the long term, Nelees One will enable an ecosystem of interoperable modules:
        smart lighting, distributed audio, HVAC control, environment sensing,
        edge compute nodes, and even micro-servers — all mounted out of the way, in a unified tessellated design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't just a smart ceiling. It's a smarter way to build systems that live with us.
